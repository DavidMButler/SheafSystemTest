Executing SheafScope:
-----------------------

Assuming the suporting libraries have not been moved since
building SheafScope simply type:
 
  SheafScope


Executing ViewerDemo:
-----------------------

The ViewerDemo depends on data files created with the
data generators test_case_3d.t, test_case_3d_irregular.t,
and test_case_2d.t include in this directory.  Each test
case creates sections with scalar, vector, and tensor data.
To execute the test generators with default mesh dimensions
type the name of the excutables, ie:

    test_case_3d.t
    test_case_3d_irregular.t
    test_case_2d.t

or type

   create_test_data

Either of these steps creates data files named "test_3d.hdf",
"test_3d_irregular.hdf, and "test_2d.hdf".

Then to view and interact with the data enter

    ViewerDemo -t=TYPE test_3d.hdf test_3d_irregular.hdf

where TYPE must be either "solid", "scalar", "vector",
or "tensor" (without the double quotes).  The "solid"
will just show geometry. The "scalar" options displays the
scalar values. The "vector" option begins by displaying
the vector magnitude as the scalar and allows either
"hedgehog" or "glyphs" to be selected to show vector
magnitude and direction.  The "tensor" option shows
the mean stress as the scalar and allows tensor glyphs
(ellipsoids) to be shown (see the "Options" menu).

The ViewDemo (including can also be executed including
tensor data generation) by executing

    make demo
