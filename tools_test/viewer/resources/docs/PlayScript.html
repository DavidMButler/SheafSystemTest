    Multi-scene scripts can be animated in real time or made into movies. 
    The VCR controls and time slider on the toolbar allows the user to
    manipulate the animation. Moving the time slider has two functions:
    <ol>
      <li>In a multi-scene script when the time is changed, the closest scene to that
	time is retrieved from the script.  The scene time is synchronized with the
	time indicated on the slider and is displayed on the stage.</li>
      <li>In a single-scene script when the time is changed, the current
	stage scene time is synchronized with the time indicated on the slider
	and is displayed on the stage.</li>
    </ol>

    <i>Note: The difference between these functions is subtle but important.  In a
    multi-scene script, changes to the current stage scene will be lost when the time
    slider is moved.</i>

    Recording a movie will prompt the user for a '.mov' file for saving.
    The rendering of the scenes will be done off-screen so the viewport will be
    inactive. Once the movie recording is complete, the finished movie will be
    pop-up in the LPS Viewer's movie viewer. Two files will be written; the
    '.mov' Quicktime&reg; file and the '.mhr' header file which
    allows the LPS Viewer's movie viewer to display time information.
    The '.mov' file can be viewed in any Quicktime&reg; viewer. To view a
    movie within the LPS Viewer, click <b>Script > Open Movie</b> and select
    the movie file to be viewed.
