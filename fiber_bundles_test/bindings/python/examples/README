README FOR bindings/python/examples:
------------------------------------

Note that in order to execute the example scripts in this directory,
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set to include the locations
of the following shared library files:

    libSheaf.so
    libBundle.so
    libFEA.so
    _sheafmod.so
    _bundlemod.so
    _feamod.so

By default, these files are in $COMPONENTS_DIR/lib
where $COMPONENTS_DIR is something like /home/wemason/components.

Also, the PYTHONPATH environemt variable should be set
to the locations of the python scripts.  By default these
are located in the current directory and in components/bindings/lib.
So the following should work (in csh/tcsh)

    setenv PYTHONPATH .:$COMPONENTS_DIR/lib
